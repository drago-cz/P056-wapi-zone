# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-05-09

### Added
- Introduced `parse_zone_file` to simplify parsing `.zone` files. The function supports both inline TTLs and `$ORIGIN/$TTL` directives with relative names.
  
### Changed
- Updated `list_dns_domains` to handle `domain` data in both `dict` and `list` formats and improved error handling for DNS fetching.
- Enhanced `generate_zone_files` to adapt to multiple DNS domain data formats and streamlined the zone file generation process.
- Refactored `compare_zone_ns` for cleaner logic by leveraging the `parse_zone_file` helper function.
- Simplified `sync_zone_records` by replacing manual zone record mapping logic with the use of `parse_zone_file`.

### Removed
- Deprecated manual parsing logic for `.zone` files in `compare_zone_ns` and `sync_zone_records`.
